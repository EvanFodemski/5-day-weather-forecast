## Description
In this project I developed a 5 day weather forecast with an API. Using this application one can check for weather in any city registered in the Google Weather API. This project also saves recent search history with local Storage.
## Features
List out the key features of your offline text editor.

## Installation

1. Clone The repository

2. In your Code Editor, open the HTML file in your `Default Browser`.



## Usage
When on the application, you can search for cities, and when you do, the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days will display on the screen. The city you searched for will also be added to the search history on the left hand side.
